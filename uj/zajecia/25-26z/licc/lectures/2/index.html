<h1>Legacy and Influence of Confucian Culture on Modern Korean Society<br><br>The Four Books</h1>

<h2>Analects (<i>Lunyu</i>, 論語, 논어)</h2>

<h3>1.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>The Master said, To learn and rehearse it constantly, is this indeed not a pleasure? To have friends come from afar, is this indeed not a delight? Others do not know him, yet he feels no resentment, is he indeed not a superior man?</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>2.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>One who is of filial and fraternal character but at the same time loves defying superiors is rare indeed. One who does not love defying superiors but at the same time loves sowing disorder has never existed. The superior man attends to the root. The root having been established, the Way issues forth. And filial piety and fraternal respect—are they not the root of practicing true goodness?</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>3.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>The Master said, Clever words and ingratiating looks—seldom are they associated with true goodness.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>4.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>Every day I examine my own person on three counts: In working on behalf of others, have I failed to be true to myself? In my associations with friends, have I failed to be true to my word? As for what has been passed on to me, have I failed to rehearse it?</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>5.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>Worry not that others do not know you; worry lest you do not know others.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>6.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>The Master said, One who practices government by virtue may be compared to the North Star: it remains in its place while the multitude of other stars turn toward it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>7.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>The Master said, Lead them with tools of government, regulate them by punishment, and the people will avoid punishment but have no sense of shame. Lead them with virtue, regulate them by ritual, and they will have a sense of shame and moreover arrive at good.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>8.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>The Master said, At fifteen, I set my mind-and-heart on learning. At thirty, I stood on my own. At forty, I had no doubts. At fifty, I knew heaven’s decree. At sixty, my ears were in accord. At seventy, I followed the desires of my mind-and-heart.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>9.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>The Master said, Nowadays to be “filial” means simply to be capable of providing parents with nourishment. But even dogs and horses get their nourishment from us. Without the feeling of reverence, what difference is there?</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>11.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>The Master said, Practice comes before the preaching; only then does the preaching follow.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>12.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>The Master said, To know it and to recognize that you know it; not to know it and to recognize that you do not know it. This is knowing.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>13.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>Duke Ai asked, What can be done so that the people will be obedient? The Master responded, Raise up the straight, place them over the crooked, and the people will be obedient; raise up the crooked, place them over the straight, and the people will not be obedient.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>15.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>Liu Fang asked about the fundamentals of ritual. The Master said, A big question indeed. In ritual, it is better to be frugal than extravagant; in mourning rites, it is better to be sorrowful than meticulous.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>17.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>The Master said, Wealth and official rank are what every man desires. If he comes by them undeservedly, he will not abide in them. Poverty and low station are what every man detests. If he comes by them undeservedly, he does not avoid them. The superior man who departs from true goodness, how does he fulfill the name? The superior man does not depart from true goodness for the space of a single meal. In times of haste he keeps to it, and in times of confusion he keeps to it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>20.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>The Master said, The superior man understands righteousness; the small person understands profit.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>21.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>When you see a worthy man, think about equaling him. When you see an unworthy man, look within yourself.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>22.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>The Master said, The superior man desires to be slow in word but quick in deed.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>23.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>The Master said, Virtue never dwells alone; it is sure to have neighbors.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>25.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>Ji Wenzi [a minister of the state Lu] would act only after considering it three times. Upon hearing of this, the Master said, Twice is sufficient.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>26.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>The Master said, Sadly, I have yet to meet a person who can see his own faults and in his own mind bring the charges against himself.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>33.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>The superior man who learns widely in the culture and keeps to the essential through ritual surely will not transgress.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>40.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>The Master said, Walking in a group of three, I am sure to have teachers. I pick out the good points and follow them and the bad points and change them in myself.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>41.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>The Master taught four things: culture, conduct, doing one’s best, and being true to others.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>42.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>The Master said, Is true goodness indeed so far away? If I desired true goodness, true goodness would be right at hand.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>44.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>The Master said, The superior man is calm and at ease; the small person is constantly apprehensive.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>45.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>A gentleman must be broad and resolute, for the burden is heavy and the journey is long. He takes true goodness as his burden: is that not indeed heavy? And only with death does he stop: is that not indeed long?</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>46.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>The Master said, People can be made to follow it, but they cannot be made to understand it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>47.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>The Master said, To study for three years without fancying an official salary—such a person is not easy to find.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>48.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>Be firm in commitment and fond of learning; be content to die and adept at the Way. Do not enter a state in danger; do not reside in a state in disorder. When the Way prevails under heaven, show yourself; when the Way does not prevail, remain hidden. When the Way prevails in the state, be ashamed of being poor and humble; when the Way does not prevail in the state, be ashamed of being wealthy and of high rank.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>49.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>The Master said, Study as though you will not catch up to it, as though you fear even losing sight of it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>51.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>The Master was entirely free of four things. He was not selfish, insistent, stubborn, or egotistical.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>54.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>The Master wished to settle among the nine barbarian tribes in the east. Someone said, But what about their crudeness? The Master said, If a superior man were to settle among them, there would be no crudeness.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>55.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>The Master, standing by the side of a stream, said, It flows on and on like this, never stopping, day or night.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>56.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>The Master said, I have yet to meet a person who loves virtue as much as he loves beautiful women.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>57.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>The Master said, The young should be held in awe. How do we know that in the future they will not be the equals of us today? If, however, at the age of forty or fifty they have not distinguished themselves, then indeed they do not deserve to be held in awe.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>58.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>Make being true to yourself and true to others your guiding rule. Do not befriend those unlike you. And when you err, do not be afraid to correct yourself.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>59.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>The Master said, The wise are not misled; the truly good are not anxious; the courageous are not afraid.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>60.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>If a mat was not straight he would not sit on it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>62.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>When climbing into a carriage he would always stand up straight and grab the mounting strap. Once inside the carriage, he would not glance about, speak with haste, or point with his hand.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>65.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>Jilu asked about serving the spirits. The Master said, Unable to serve man, how are we able to serve the spirits? He then ventured to ask about death. The Master said, Not understanding life, how can we understand death?</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>66.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>Zigong asked, Who is more worthy, Shi or Shang? The Master said, Shi goes too far and Shang not far enough. He said, In that case isn’t Shi superior? The Master said, Going too far is the same as not going far enough.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>67.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>Zilu asked about immediately putting into practice what one hears. The Master said, You have a father and older brother to consider. How can you immediately put into practice what you hear? Ranyu asked about immediately putting into practice what one hears. The Master said, Immediately put into practice what you hear. Gongxi Hua said, When Yu asked about immediately putting into practice what one hears, the Master said, You have a father and older brother to consider. When Qiu asked about immediately putting into practice what one hears, the Master said, Immediately put into practice what you hear. Now, I, Chi, am confused and dare to ask. The Master said, Qiu holds himself back, so I urged him on; Yu has the energy of two, so I held him back.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>68.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>Yan Yuan asked about true goodness. The Master said, To subdue the self and return to ritual constitutes true goodness. If only for a single day someone subdues the self and returns to ritual, all under heaven will recognize his true goodness. The practice of true goodness rests with oneself, not with others. Yan Yuan said, I beg to know the details. The Master said, If contrary to ritual, do not look; if contrary to ritual, do not listen; if contrary to ritual, do not speak; if contrary to ritual, do not act. Yan Yuan said, Although I, Hui, am not clever, I beg to devote myself to these words.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>69.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>Zigong asked about government. The Master said, Let food be sufficient, let military preparations be sufficient, and let the people have faith in you. Zigong said, If you have absolutely no choice but to give up one of the three, which should go first? He said, Let the military preparations go. Zigong said, If you have absolutely no choice but to give up one of the remaining two, which should go first? Let the food go first. Since ancient times, nobody has escaped death. The people, without faith, have nothing on which to stand.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>70.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>Duke Jing of Qi asked Confucius about governing. Confucius responded, Let the ruler be a ruler, the minister a minister, the father a father, and the son a son. The Duke said, Very good indeed! Truly, if the ruler is not a ruler, the minister not a minister, the father not a father, and the son not a son, even though there be sufficient grain, would I get to eat it?</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>71.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>In hearing lawsuits I am just like others. What is necessary is to see that there are no lawsuits.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>72.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>The superior man promotes the good in others, not the bad. The small person does the opposite.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>73.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>Ji Kangzi [de facto ruler of Lu from 492–468 BCE] asked Confucius about governing. Confucius responded, To govern (<i>zheng</i> 政) means to
correct (<i>zheng</i> 正). If you lead by correcting yourself, who would dare to remain incorrect?</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>74.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>Ji Kangzi asked Confucius about government, saying, Suppose I were to kill the Way-less in order to promote those possessed of the Way. What would you say? Confucius responded, You are governing; what need is there for killing? If you desire good, the people will be good. The virtue of the superior man is wind; the virtue of the small person is grass. When wind passes over it, the grass is sure to bend.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>75.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>Zilu said, If the ruler of Wei were awaiting your services in government, what would you do first? The Master said, It most certainly would be the rectification of names. Zilu said, Is that right? How impractical you are. Why this rectification? The Master said, How crude you are, Yu. The superior man, when it comes to matters he does not understand, should offer no opinion. If names are not rectified, words will not agree with reality; if words do not agree, then affairs will not result in success. If affairs do not result in success, then rites and music will not prosper; if rites and music do not prosper, then punishments will not be correct; if punishments are not correct, then the people will have no place to put hand or foot. Therefore, as to the superior man—when he names something it is sure to be sayable, and when he says something it is sure to be practicable. With respect to words the superior man is not careless in the slightest.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>76.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>The Master said, If his person is correct, without his giving orders they will be carried out; if his person is not correct, though he gives orders they will not be obeyed.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>79.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>The Duke of She spoke with Confucius, saying, In our community there was a certain “Mr. Upright.” When his father stole a sheep, the son gave evidence against him. Confucius said, In our community the upright are different from this. A father covers up for his son and a son covers up for his father. This is where uprightness is to be found.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>80.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>Fan Chi asked about true goodness. The Master said, At home be respectful; in managing affairs be attentive; with others do the best you can. Even though you go to dwell among the Yi or Di barbarians, you must not abandon these qualities.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>81.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>The Master said, To be resolute and firm, simple and slow in speech, is to approach true goodness.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>82.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>The Master said, The superior man reaches high; the small person reaches low.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>83.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>The Master said, In ancient times, those who learned did so for the sake of themselves; nowadays those who learn do so for the sake of others.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>84.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>The Master said, The superior man is ashamed lest his words surpass his deeds.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>85.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>The Master said, The Ji horse was not praised for its strength but for its good character.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>86.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>The Master said, Alas, no one knows me! Zigong said, Why is it that no one knows you? The Master said, I do not blame heaven nor do I fault man. I study low to reach high—it must be heaven that knows me.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>92.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>The Master said, The superior man is distressed by his own inability, not by others not knowing him.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>93.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>The Master said, The superior man seeks it within himself; the small person seeks it within others.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>94.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>Zigong asked, Is there one word that can be practiced for the whole of one’s life? The Master said, That would be “empathy” perhaps: what you do not wish yourself do not do unto others.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>95.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>The Master said, Man is capable of broadening the Way; it is not the Way that broadens man.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>96.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>The Master said, Erring and not reforming: this indeed is what is meant by erring!</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>97.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>The Master said, Once I did not eat for the entire day or sleep for the entire night in order to think. It was of no use. Better to learn.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>98.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>The Master said, True goodness is more essential to the people than water and fire. I have seen people who have died by treading on water and fire; never have I seen a person die treading the path of true goodness.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>100.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>Those born knowing it are the highest, those who through learning come to know it are next, those who learn it but with difficulty are next, and those who because of difficulty do not learn it, these people are the lowest.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>102.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>The Master said, Only the most wise and most stupid do not change.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>103.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>The Master said, “Ritual, ritual”: does it mean nothing more than jade and silk? “Music, music”: does it mean nothing more than bells and drums?</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>104.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>The Master said, I wish to give up speech. Zigong said, If you, our Master, were not to speak, what would we, your disciples, transmit? The Master said, Does heaven speak? From it the four seasons take their course; from it the hundred things receive life. Does heaven speak?</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>107.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>He who day to day recognizes where he is lacking, and month to month forgets not where he is capable, can be said to be fond of learning indeed.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>110.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>The mistakes of the superior man are like the eclipses of the sun and moon. When he makes a mistake, everyone sees it. When he corrects it, everyone looks up to him.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>111.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p> The Master said, Without an understanding of fate he has no way of becoming a superior man; without an understanding of ritual he has no way to take a stand; without an understanding of words he has no way to understand people.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Mencius (<i>Mengzi</i>, 孟子, 맹자)</h2>

<h3>5.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>Mencius said to King Xuan of Qi: “Suppose one of Your Majesty’s ministers entrusts his wife and children to a friend and then takes leave to journey to Chu, only to find, upon his return, that his wife and children suffer from cold and famine: What should be done?” He said, “Break off the friendship.” He said, “Suppose the chief judge proved incapable of managing the junior judges: What should be done?” The king said, “Remove him.” Suppose that all within the four borders is not well governed: What should be done?” The king looked around to his left and to his right and then spoke of other matters.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>8.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>All people have a mind-and-heart that cannot bear to see the suffering of others. Former kings had a mind-and-heart that could not bear to see the suffering of others and thus had governments that could not bear to see the suffering of others. Ruling all under heaven was as simple for them as rolling it in the palm of the hand. Here is why I say that all men have a mind-and-heart that cannot bear to see the suffering of others: Today, no matter the person, if he suddenly comes upon a young child about to fall into a well, his mind-and-heart fills with alarm and is moved to compassion. It is not because he wishes to ingratiate himself with the parents of the young child; nor is it because he seeks renown among villagers and friends; nor is it because he would hate the bad reputation. From this we can see that to be without a mind-and-heart of compassion is not to be human; to be without a mind-and-heart that is ashamed of evil in oneself and hates it in others is not to be human; to be without a mind-and-heart of humility and deference is not to be human; to be without a mind-and-heart of right and wrong is not to be human. The mind-and-heart of compassion is the seed of benevolence; the mind-and-heart that is ashamed of evil in oneself and hates it in others is the seed of righteousness; the mind-and-heart of humility and deference is the seed of propriety; the mind-and-heart of right and wrong is the seed of wisdom. People have these four seeds just as they have the four limbs. To have these four seeds but to deny their potential in oneself is to rob from oneself. To deny their potential in the ruler is to rob from the ruler. All of us have these four seeds within us; if we know to develop and bring each to completion, it will be like a blaze catching fire or a spring finding a path. He who is able to bring them to completion is capable of preserving all within the four seas; he who doesn’t complete them is incapable of caring for his parents.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>13.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>Mencius said, “By being truly good the Three Dynasties won the empire; by not being good they lost the empire. A state too rises and falls, persists and perishes, by the same means. If the Son of Heaven is not truly good, he cannot preserve all within the four seas; if the feudal lord is not truly good, he cannot preserve the spirits of the soil and the grain [that protect his state]; if the high official is not truly good, he cannot preserve his ancestral temple; if the common person is not truly good, he cannot preserve his four limbs. Now, to despise death and yet delight in not being good is like despising drunkenness and yet indulging in strong wine.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>14.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>Mencius said, “There is a common saying among the people: ‘The empire, the state, and the family’: the foundation of the empire lies with the state; the foundation of the state lies with the family; the foundation of the family lies with the person.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>15.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>Chunyu Kuan said, “Isn’t it a matter of ritual that men and women, in giving to and receiving from each other, are not to touch?” Mencius said, “Yes, it is.” He said, “Suppose a sister-in-law is drowning: do you extend a hand to rescue her?” Mencius said, “If a sister-in-law is drowning and you do not rescue her—this is to be a cruel beast. Men and women, in giving to and receiving from each other, are not to touch. Such is the ritual. But to extend a hand to rescue a drowning sister-in-law is to weigh the circumstances and act accordingly.” He said, “Today, the empire is drowning but you, sir, do not rescue it. Why is that?” Mencius said, “When the empire is drowning, you rescue it with the Way. You want to rescue the empire with a hand?”</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>16.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>Mencius said, “There are three ways to be unfilial. To have no heir is the most serious. Shun married without informing his parents, because he feared that he would have no heir. The view of the superior man is that this is the same as having informed his parents.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>17.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>Mencius said, “The actualization of true goodness is serving our parents; the actualization of righteousness is obeying our elder brothers; the actualization of wisdom is understanding these two [true goodness and righteousness] and never departing from them; the actualization of rites is the regulation and adornment of these two.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>18.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>Mencius said, “When the sovereign is truly good, everybody will be truly good; when the sovereign is righteous, everybody will be righteous.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>19.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>Mencius said, “Ritual that is not ritual, righteousness that is not righteousness—these are things the great person does not practice.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>20.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>Mencius said, “Only a person who refuses to act in some matters is capable of action in others.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>21.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>Mencius said, “The great person is one who does not lose his mind-and-heart of a child.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>22.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>Mencius said, “The superior man advances persistently along the proper path, hoping to get it for himself. Getting it for himself he rests in it at ease; resting in it at ease he trusts in it deeply; trusting in it deeply he penetrates its source in whatever is around him. It is for this reason that the superior man hopes to get it for himself.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>23.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>Mencius said, “Slight is the difference between man and beast. The common person lets go of it; the superior man holds on to it. Shun was insightful about the world around him and observant of human relationships. The source of his actions was true goodness and righteousness; it was not just that he was practicing acts of true goodness and righteousness.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>28.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>Gaozi said, “Human nature may be likened to the willow and righteousness to cups and bowls. Making true goodness and righteousness out of human nature is like making cups and bowls out of the willow.” Mencius responded, “Are you able to make cups and bowls by following the nature of the willow? It is only by doing violence to the willow that you can make cups and bowls. If you do violence to the willow in making cups and bowls, must you also do violence to a person in making true goodness and righteousness? It is sure to be words like yours that induce people everywhere to regard goodness and righteousness as injurious.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>29.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>Gaozi said, “Human nature is like swirling water. Cut a passage for it in the east and it flows east; cut a passage for it in the west and it flows west. There is no distinction in human nature between good and bad just as there is no distinction in water between east and west.” Mencius said, “It is true that in the case of water there is no distinction between east and west. But is there no distinction between up and down? The goodness of human nature is like water’s flowing downhill. Every person is good; all water flows downhill. Now, take water: hit it with your hand or jump into it and you can make it splash higher than your forehead; dam it up, then channel it, and you can make it climb a mountain. Can this possibly be the nature of water? It is circumstances [external to it] that make it so. That a person can be made to do what is not good is a matter of his nature being like that of water in this regard.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>32.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>Mencius responded, “Our natural tendency is to do good. This is what I mean by its [i.e., the nature’s] being good. Doing what is not good is not the fault of our natural disposition. Each and every one of us possesses the mind-and-heart of compassion; the mind-and-heart that is ashamed of evil in oneself and detests it in others; the mind-and-heart of respectfulness and reverence; and the mind-and-heart of right and wrong. The mind-and-heart of compassion is true goodness; the mind-and-heart that is ashamed of evil in oneself and hates it in others is righteousness; the mind-and-heart of respectfulness and reverence is propriety; and the mind-and-heart of right and wrong is wisdom. True goodness, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom are not welded on to us from without. We possess them from the very beginning, but we just do not think about it. Thus it is said, ‘Seek and you will find it; let go of it and you will lose it.’</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>34.</h3>

	<p>When a person follows his originally good mind-and-heart, there are means he will not employ even to remain alive; when a person follows this mind-and-heart, there are things he will not do even if they enable him to avoid calamity. Therefore, we have that which we desire more than life and that which we loathe more than death. It is not the worthy person alone who possesses such a mind-and-heart; all people possess it. But the worthy person never loses it, that’s all.</p>

	<p>Mencius said, “True goodness (ren 仁) is the mind-and-heart of a person (ren 人); righteousness is his path. How pitiable it is to give up the path and follow it no longer; to let go of the mind and not know enough to seek after it. A person who has lost chickens and dogs knows to seek after them; yet when he loses the mind-and-heart he does not know enough to seek after it. The way of learning is nothing more than to seek after this lost mind-and-heart.”</p>

	<p>Gongduzi asked, “If we are all equally human, why are some great persons and others are small persons?” Mencius said, “According with the body in its great aspects makes for a great person; according with the body in its small aspects makes for a small person.” Gongduzi said, “If we are all equally human, why do some accord with the body in its great aspects and some accord with the body in its small aspects?” Mencius responded, “Since the function of the eyes and ears does not include the ability to think, they are misled by other creaturely things. When a thing mingles with other things, it can easily be led astray. The function of the mind-and-heart is to think; if it does its thinking it will get it, but if it doesn’t it will not. This is what heaven gives to us. If we first take our stand on what is great [i.e., the mind-and-heart], then what is small is unable to do violence to it. It is this and this alone that makes for the great person.”</p>

	<p>Mencius said, “A person, in giving full realization to his mind-and-heart, knows his nature; and knowing his nature, he knows heaven. By preserving his mind-and-heart and nurturing his nature, he serves heaven. Whether his life is to be short or long does not weigh on him; he cultivates himself and waits for death. This is how he stands firm in his fate.”</p>

	<p>Mencius said, “ ‘Seek and you will find it, let it go and you will lose it.’ This is a seeking that helps in the getting; it is the seeking inside oneself. ‘Seeking is to follow a proper course; getting is a matter of fate.’ This is a seeking that is of no help in the getting; it is the seeking outside oneself.”</p>

	<p>Mencius said, “What people are able to do without having learned it—this is innate, good ability. What they know without having pondered it—this is innate, good knowledge. There is no child of two or three years who does not know to love his parents; as they grow up, there is none who does not know to respect his elder brothers. To treat parents with the love due parents is a matter of true goodness; to treat elders with the respect due elders is a matter of righteousness—and nothing more. This is true everywhere under heaven.”</p>

Thus, win over the peasants to become the ruler; win over the Son of Heaven to become a feudal lord; win over the feudal lord to become a high official. When a feudal lord imperils the altar to the spirits of earth and grain, he is replaced.

	<p>When every movement and every expression accords perfectly with ritual, this is virtue at its fullest. Being sorrowful in mourning the dead is not for the sake of impressing the living.

The superior man follows the norm and awaits his fate, and that is all. </p>

<h2>The Great Learning (<i>Daxue</i>, 大學, 대학)</h2>

<blockquote class="bookquote">

	<p>Those of antiquity who wished that all people throughout the empire would let their inborn luminous virtue shine forth put governing their states well first; wishing to govern their states well, they first established harmony in their households; wishing to establish harmony in their households, they first cultivated themselves; wishing to cultivate themselves, they first set their minds in the right; wishing to set their minds in the right, they first made their intentions true; wishing to make their intentions true, they first extended knowledge to the utmost; the extension of knowledge lies in the investigation of things.</p>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>Only after things are investigated does knowledge become complete; knowledge being complete, intentions become true; intentions being true, the mind becomes set in the right; the mind being so set, the person becomes cultivated; the person being cultivated, harmony is established in the household; household harmony established, the state becomes well governed; the state being well governed, the empire becomes tranquil.</p>

<h2>Doctrine of the Mean (<i>Zhongyong</i>, 中庸, 중용)</h2>

<h3>1-1.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>What heaven decrees is called “the nature”; to follow the nature is called “the Way”; to cultivate the Way is called “instruction.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>1-2.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>The Way: it must not be abandoned for even a moment. What can be abandoned is not the Way. Consequently, the superior man treats with extreme care even that not visible to him; and treats with apprehension even that beyond the reach of his hearing.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>1-3.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>Nothing is more manifest than the hidden, nothing more obvious than the subtle. Thus the superior man, even in solitude, is watchful over himself.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>1-4.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>Before pleasure, anger, sorrow, and joy have arisen—this we call perfect balance. After they have arisen and attained due proportion—this we call harmony. Perfect balance is the great foundation of the universe; harmony is the Way that unfolds throughout the universe.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>1-5.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>Let perfect balance and harmony be realized and heaven and earth will find their proper places therein; and, the ten thousand creatures will be nourished therein.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>2-2.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>Confucius said, “The superior man maintains perfect balance and keeps to the constant because, as a superior man, he accords with circumstances in finding the perfect balance. The small man turns his back on perfect balance and the constant because, as a small man, he is devoid of fear and restraint.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>3-1.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>The Master said, “Maintaining perfect balance and holding to the constant: this is the highest attainment. For a long time now few people have shown the capacity for it.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>7.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>The Master said, “People all say, ‘I know.’ But drive them into a net, a trap, or a pit, and none will know how to escape. People all say, ‘I know,’ but having chosen to maintain perfect balance and to hold to the constant, they are unable to abide by them for even a month.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>13-1.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>The Master said, “The Way is not far from man. If a person in following the Way distances himself from other men, it cannot be considered the Way.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>13-3.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>Being true to himself and empathetic toward others he keeps near to the Way. What he does not wish done to him he does not do unto others.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>13-4.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>The Way of the superior man involves four things, and I, Confucius, have so far been incapable of any of them. In serving my father, I have been incapable of doing what is expected of a son; in serving my prince, I have been incapable of doing what is expected of a minister; in serving my older brother, I have been incapable of doing what is expected of a younger brother; in reaching out to friends, I have been incapable of doing what is expected of a friend. Now take the practice of everyday virtue and the exercise of care in everyday speech: if it [virtue] is inadequate he [the superior man] dares not but exert himself; if it [speech] is excessive he dares not but exercise reserve. His speech looks to his practice, and his practice looks to his speech. Is he, the superior man, not deeply sincere!</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>14-1.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>The Master said, “The superior man does what is proper to the station in which he finds himself. He has no desire to go beyond. In a position of wealth and high status he does what is proper to a position of wealth and high status; in a position of poverty and low status he does what is proper to a position of poverty and low status; in a position among barbarians he does what is proper to a position among barbarians; in a position of misfortune and hardship he does what is proper to a position of misfortune and hardship. The superior man never finds himself in a place where he is uncomfortable.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>14-2.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>In a superior position he does not offend subordinates; in a subordinate position he does not lean on superiors. He corrects himself and demands nothing from others and thus feels no ill will. Above he feels no ill will toward heaven; below he bears no grudge against men.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>14-3.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>For this reason, the superior man lives at ease awaiting his fate. The small man takes dangerous paths seeking undeserved fortune</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>14-4.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>The Master said, “The archer in some ways is similar to the superior man. Upon missing the target they turn their gaze inward and seek the cause within themselves.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>20-8.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>“The universal Way of the world is fivefold, and the means of putting it into practice are three. Ruler and minister, father and son, husband and wife, elder brother and younger brother, and friend and friend: these five relationships constitute the universal Way of the world. Wisdom, goodness, and courage: these three are the universal virtues of the world. The means of putting them into practice is oneness.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>20-9.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>“Some are born knowing it [the universal Way of the world]; others know it through study; and still others know it only through painful effort. But in knowing it they are the same. Some practice it with ease; others practice it with an eye to the benefits it will bring; and still others force themselves to practice it. But in their achievement of it, they are the same.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>20-10.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>The Master said, “To love learning is to get close to knowing it; to practice it with all one’s strength is to get close to true goodness; to know shame is to get close to courage.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>20-11.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>“Knowing these three things is to know how to cultivate oneself; knowing how to cultivate oneself is to know how to govern others; knowing how to govern others is to know how to govern the empire, the state, and the family.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>20-12.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>“All in all, in governing empire, state, and family, there are nine canons of conduct: cultivating the self; honoring the worthy; showing affection toward relatives; reverencing the great ministers; empathizing with the body of officials; treating the common people with parental love; giving encouragement to the hundred artisans; dealing gently with travelers from afar; and embracing the lords of all the states.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>20-17.</h3>

<blockquote class="bookquote">
	<p>“If those in subordinate positions do not gain the confidence of their superiors, they cannot govern the people well. There is a way to gain the confidence of one’s superiors: he who is not trusted by friends will not gain the confidence of his superiors. There is a way to win the trust of one’s friends: he who is not obedient to his parents will not win the trust of his friends. There is a way to be obedient to one’s parents: he who turns inward and finds that he is not true to himself will not be obedient to his parents. There is a way to make oneself true: he who does not understand perfect goodness will not be true to himself.”</p>
